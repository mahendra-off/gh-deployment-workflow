GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
This repository demonstrates a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy changes to index.html to GitHub Pages.
Project Structure

index.html: The main HTML file that gets deployed to GitHub Pages.
.github/workflows/deploy.yml: The GitHub Actions workflow file that handles deployment.
README.md: This file, explaining the project.

How It Works

The GitHub Actions workflow triggers on any push to the main branch.
It checks if index.html has been modified.
If changes are detected, it deploys the file to GitHub Pages.
The deployed site is accessible at https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/.
